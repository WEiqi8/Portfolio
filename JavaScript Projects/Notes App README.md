## Overview

This project is a lightweight yet powerful notes application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap. It provides a clean, card-based interface for managing personal notes with a focus on simplicity and usability. The application uses browser localStorage to save notes, making them persistent between sessions without requiring a backend server.

## Features

- **Local Storage**: Notes are saved in your browser's localStorage
- **Detailed View**: Click on any note to view its full content
- **Note Management**: Edit or delete notes with intuitive controls
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Auto-Save Drafts**: Never lose your work with automatic draft saving
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find notes by title or content (available as extension)
- **Sort Options**: Organize notes by date or title (available as extension)
- **Empty State Handling**: Friendly message when no notes exist
